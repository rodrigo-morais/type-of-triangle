# Type of Triangle

This is a simple website where the user can inform the 3 sides of a triangle and get the type of the generated triangle

#### The triangle can have three types:

  SCALENE -> the sides have different values

  ISOSCELES -> two sides have the same value

  EQUILATERAL -> all sides have the same value

#### If the sides have an invalid value then it is not possible generate a triangle:
  - if any side has a value equal or less than 0
  - if one side is bigger than the sum of other two
